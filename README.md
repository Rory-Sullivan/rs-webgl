# RS WebGL Demo

![screenshot](/images/screenshot_01.png)

I recently got inspired to start working with WebGL. This is a quick demo I put
together using three.js. It is a port of a scene from my [ray tracing
engine](https://github.com/Rory-Sullivan/rs_ray_tracer). Try it out
[here](https://rory-sullivan.github.io/rs-webgl/).
